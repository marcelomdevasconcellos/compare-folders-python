# compare-folders-python

This program recursively compares the files of two folders.

The list of files comes from the original folder, so files 
that exist in the copy folder and do not exist in the original 
folder will not be compared.

usage: ```python compare_folders.py [-h] --original-folder ORIGINAL_FOLDER --copy-folder COPY_FOLDER```
